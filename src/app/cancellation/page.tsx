        Upon completing a Transaction, you are entering into a legally binding
        and enforceable agreement with us to purchase the product and/or
        service. After this point the User may cancel the Transaction unless it
        has been specifically provided for on the Platform. In which case, the
        cancellation will be subject to the terms mentioned on the Platform. We
        shall retain the discretion in approving any cancellation requests and
        we may ask for additional details before approving any requests. Once
        you have received the product and/or service, the only event where you
        can request for a replacement or a return and a refund is if the product
        and/or service does not match the description as mentioned on the
        Platform. Any request for refund must be submitted within three days
        from the date of the Transaction or such number of days prescribed on
        the Platform, which shall in no event be less than three days. A User
        may submit a claim for a refund for a purchase made, by raising a ticket
        here or contacting us on
        seller+12d7dd52d6b741a68a8922090fafd735@instamojo.com and providing a
        clear and specific reason for the refund request, including the exact
        terms that have been violated, along with any proof, if required.
        Whether a refund will be provided will be determined by us, and we may
        ask for additional details before approving any requests.
